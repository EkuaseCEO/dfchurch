        Our mission is simple yet impactful: to support our neighbors, reduce the burden of hunger, and prevent the hardship and isolation that can come from not having enough to eat. The food bank is more than just a resource—it’s a safe haven that stands as a testament to Canada’s commitment to the United Nations Human Right to Life. By putting food on the table, we help restore dignity and hope, complementing vital social services at all levels of government.

Together, we are building a more compassionate, resilient, and caring community—where no one faces hunger alone. We invite you to join us in this mission, whether through volunteering, donations, or spreading the word. Every act of kindness counts toward a brighter future for all.

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 leading-relaxed p-6 rounded">
  <li>In the Divine inspiration of the Bible and as the infallible Word of God.</li>
  <li>The Divine Trinity consists of three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</li>
  <li>The Deity of Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, teachings, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and coming return to this earth in power and glory to rule.</li>
  <li>That Man was created in the image of God before whom he walked in innocence, holiness and purity, but by voluntary disobedience and transgression, he fell to the depths of sin. Therefore, the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the finished work at Calvary.</li>
  <li>That Perfection is a spiritual growth for those who have been sanctified and consecrated unto God.</li>
  <li>In the Baptism of the Holy Ghost for all believers who are living sanctified lives and that it is evidenced by the speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterances.</li>
  <li>That Divine Healing of sickness for all believers is provided through the atonement.</li>
  <li>The second coming of Jesus and the Rapture of the church.</li>
  <li>That Tribulation will occur between Christ’s second coming for his bride and His return in Judgment.</li>
  <li>In the 1000 year reign of Jesus Christ on earth.</li>
  <li>The Great White Throne Judgment as the final judgment when all the wicked will stand before God.</li>
  <li>The new heaven and new earth will replace the current heaven and earth.</li>
  <li>In Eternal heaven and Eternal hell as literal places of final destiny.</li>
  <li>In Water baptism by immersion as Jesus commanded.</li>
  <li>In Restitution where stolen goods are returned to their rightful owners.</li>
  <li>In the Lord’s supper, practiced to remember His death until He returns.</li>
